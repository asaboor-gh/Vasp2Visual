for Vasp output. Scripts allow user take full control of their vasp
output data. You can plot on your own by just getting data in column
format through using the command ``Export-VaspRun`` in a folder
containing ``vasprun.xml``.

--

The plot file is generated after running ``Get-Plot`` is editable per
your choice,although the plot you get is publication ready.

--

-  You are strongly recommended to download `STIX
   Fonts <https://www.stixfonts.org/>`__ to make your plot fonts similar
   to article's fonts.
-  You need to install various python module including numpy, matplotlib
   and for interactive plots, you need to install
   `Plotly <https://plot.ly/python/getting-started/>`__.

--

-  The few of available commands include the following.

   .. code:: powershell

--------------

Version2 is Here!
-----------------

    Version2 provides extra commands like ``Export-VR2 -switches`` which
    accepts path to vasprun file and returns the files irrespetive you
    have ISPIN 1 or 2. It creates data in both cases automatically which
    you can use for plotting (currently spin-polarized plots not
    available, but you have data to make your own).

--

-  A separate python module
   `pivotpy <https://massgh.github.io/pivotpy/>`__ is under
   developement. The difference between powershell and python versions
   is data files and objects in memory respectively.

--

-  Powershell wrapper commands for ``pivotpy`` are available now!

Plot using ``New-Figure`` command
---------------------------------

There are multiple switches for interactive and static plots including
``sRGB``, ``iRGB`` etc. You can access all switches and parameters using
``Tab``. > Note: You need python >= 3.6 to use this command and
`pivotpy <https://massgh.github.io/pivotpy/>`__ module.

You can edit the saved python file for further tweaking. Also note that
if you want a string placed in python, like ``ctxt = 'red'`` in
``Get-FigArgs``, you have to modify it as ``$x.ctxt = " 'red' "``,
double qoutes for powershell and single qoutes will be written in python
file.

Use ``Get-POSCAR`` to acess POSCAR from `Materials Project <https://materialsproject.org/>`__
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You need Materials Project API to access their data. Function will
return a list of available POSCARs for given structure. Access data
using ``get_poscar`` from ``pivotpy`` directly on remote server. To save
``APIKey`` for autolad, open python terminal and use
``pivotpy.sio.save_mp_API('your_api_key')``, in that case you do not
need to provide api key yourself each time.

.. code:: powershell

    ‚ùØ $x = Get-POSCAR 'GaAs' -APIKey '*****' -MaxSites 8
    ‚ùØ $x[0].poscar

    PS> $x=Read-BigFile -FilePath E:\Research\Current\pDOS.txt -StopIndex 5
    PS> Write-BigStream -StreamArray $x -FilePath E:\Research\Current\new.txt -AsOneLine

-  Note: Both ``Read-BigFile`` and ``Write-BigStream`` requires full
   file path to work properly but they reslove relative path as well.
   These functions are useful to parse big files like LOCPOT which
   otherwise are timely expensive.

--------------

Get-IntoYourWorkStation
-----------------------

-  Launch your Powershell console and run
   ``Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted``. This will allow you to run
   scripts.

--

Direct Install (Not recommended, its behind github)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  For direct install from Powerhell Gallery, follow link
   `Vasp2Visual@PSGallery <https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/Vasp2Visual/1.0.3.0>`__
   and follow guidlines or run the command below in the console

   .. code:: powershell

       Install-Module Vasp2Visual
       #Click Y for what prompts in console.

--

Download from Github (Recommended for latest updates)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Find the path to Powershell Module by running ``$env:PSModulePath``
   command and then download the directory `Vasp2Visual <Vasp2Visual>`__
   in that path. There are usually three paths.

   .. code:: powershell

       PS> $env:PSModulePath

   ::

       C:\Users\mass_\Documents\WindowsPowerShell\Modules;
       C:\Program Files\WindowsPowerShell\Modules;
       C:\WINDOWS\system32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\Modules

--------------

After Installation Steps
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Running ``Import-Module Vasp2Visual`` in Powershell console will make
   all commands in this module available to use. If you want to make it
   permanent, include this import command in your powershell profile by
   typying ``your_editor $PROFILE``.
-  Now run ``Get-Module`` command. This will show you that Vasp2Visual
   is ready and you can see list of commands.

--

-  You need vasprun.xml file to collect data. It is recommended that if
   you have ``vasprun.xml`` file from DOS calculations,put that file in
   a folder named ``dos`` or ``DOS`` in the root folder where
   vasprun.xml is present from a bandstructure calculation and
   ``run plotting commands only in root folder`` but run
   ``Export-VaspRun`` in each folder in case of BandDOS composite plots.

--------------

Get-FunctionsWork
-----------------

To import Vasp2Visual and see if it is available in current session, run

.. code:: powershell

    PS> Import-Module Vasp2Visual
    PS> Get-Module  #will give all imported modules including the one you just imported

::

    Script     1.0.0.0    Vasp2Visual                         {Close-Writers, Get-KPath, Get-Plot, Get-PlotArguments...}

--

To permanently import it into your profile, run the following cmdlet

.. code:: powershell

    PS> "Import-Module Vasp2Visual"|Add-Content $PROFILE

--

If you are working in WSL on windows, you probably encounter switching
between windows and linux terminals, so here is a function that changes
the current windows directory path into Linux and LaTeX path formats.

.. code:: powershell

    PS> Out-Path -AbsolutePath ./GaAs

::

    Name                           Value
    ----                           -----
    LinuxPath                      /mnt/Full Path Required for WSL./GaAs
    LatexPath                      ./GaAs
    OnClipboard                    /mnt/Full Path Required for WSL./GaAs
    #So you need absolute path to enter in WSL from powershell. LaTeX path is fine.

--

Vasp2Visual contains a cmdlet for creating a K-Path before you run a
calculation on vasp(HSE).

.. code:: powershell

    PS> Get-KPath -KptsArray_nCross3 (0,0,0),(0.5,0.5,0.5),(0.25,0.25,0),(0.5,0,0) -nPerInterval 10

::

    File [KPath.txt] created. Output copied to clipboard.

In case you want to join two disconnected path patches, just create an
array of two arrays(of those two patches) and pipe it to a foreach loop
to create a new file.

--

Because ``Get-KPath`` creates new file each time and delete any older
file, so we get content of the file in first run before the loop goes to
second run and so on.

.. code:: powershell

    PS> ((0,0,0),(0.5,0.5,0.5)),((0.5,0,0),(0,0.5,0))|Foreach{Get-KPath $_ 3; (Get-Content .\KPath.txt)|Add-Content .\NewFile.txt}
    PS> gc NewFile.txt

::

      0.0000      0.0000       0.0000       0
      0.2500      0.2500       0.2500       0.0000
      0.5000      0.5000       0.5000       0
      0.5000      0.0000       0.0000       0
      0.2500      0.2500       0.0000       0.0000
      0.0000      0.5000       0.0000       0

--

For accessing any entry of a tabular data file, you can use the
following command

.. code:: powershell

    PS> Format-DataInFile .\Bands.txt -ViewAsExcel -DispalyFewColumns -SelectColumns 1,2,3,4,5

which gives output in an Excel-like window as shown below. You can apply
sorting operation in this window and much more. Theoretically you can
see any file this way without opening any editor or a big program like
Excel.

--

In case you want to access a data entry in column\_5, you can view it as
an indexed dataframe.

.. code:: powershell

    PS> (Format-DataInFile .\Bands.txt).B1[0]                                         
        -14.0141

.. figure:: ExcelView1.jpg
   :alt: DataView

   DataView

--------------

Collect-VaspData
----------------

In order to collect data from ``vasprun.xml``, run the command

.. code:: powershell

    PS> Export-VaspRun
    #For a system with NBANDS > 40, it will prompt to select a range of bands

::

    [SYSTEM] structure contains  64 ions and 780 bands.           
     [To get all bands, Type 530, 250] ‚áö OR ‚áõ [Collect almost ‚Üë‚Üì 30 bands around VBM]
     Seperate entries by a comma: e.g. 530, 250                         
     NBANDS_FILLED, NBANDS_EMPTY: 15,10 

--

    This will make 4 files,
    ``Bands.txt, tDOS.txt, pDOS.txt, Projection.txt`` and a
    ``SysInfo.py`` file that can be imported in python directly.
    Projections are written ion-wise in same file.

If running the above cmdlet throws an error and stops running, then you
``must run`` the following command

.. code:: powershell

    PS> Close-Writers #This will close all opened stream writers. 

--

Now you are able to use your own plotting method to get output, but you
can instead use ``Get-Plot`` function to let it work automatically for
you. Before going forward, lets get to know how many arguments are
available and then you can just edit arguments.

.. code:: powershell

    PS> $x=Get-PlotArgs  # Use switches -DOS,-Plotly, Default retrurn is for basic plots.
    PS> $x.E_Limit="[-10,15]" #sets your defined energy limit in plot
    PS> $x.ticklabels  #will show up ticklabels and you can edit
    #After editing all keys in $x.Key for your system, you can run the following cmdlet to get plot
    PS> Get-Plot -ProjectedBandDOS -PlotArguments $x #will output a plot. You can add -HalfColumnWide switch to make small size plots.

--

Export LOCPOT file into seperate x,y,z-directed potentials using

.. code:: powershell

    PS> Export-LOCPOT #Creates three plane data files consisting minimum,maximum and average potential in each direction.
    PS> Get-ConvolvedPotential -X_Dir -V_max -Interval 1,20 #gives interactive plotly graph in html format. 
    PS> Get-AlignedPotential -Z_Dir -V_min -LeftRightPositions 0.25,0.75 -Periodicity 28 -LeftRightNames 'left','right'

-  Periodicity can be obtained by ``Get-ConvolvedPotential`` with
   plotting over a guessed range of interval.

--

Aligned potential looks like the below one. |AlignPlot|

--------------

Get-PublicationsReadyPlots
--------------------------

-  Seperate and composite plots can be made using switches like
   ``-Bands``, ``-BandDOS``, ``-ProjectedBands``, ``-ProjectedBandDOS``.
   Plot size could be decreased to half of an article column width by
   using ``-HalfColumnWide`` switch. You can make your own plots from
   data.

--------------

Get-More
--------

    The most useful cmdlet is ``Get-InteractivePlot`` based on
    `Plotly <https://plot.ly/python/getting-started/>`__. You can
    interact with html graph, can switch between simple and projected
    plots and can get coordinates visually.

--

Here is how it works.

.. code:: powershell

    PS> $x=Get-Args -Plotly; $x

::

    Name                           Value
    ----                           -----
    tickIndices                    [0,30,60,90,-1]
    ticklabels                     [u'\u0393','M','K',u'\u0393','A']
    E_Limit                        [5,-5]
    ProLabels                      ['Ga','s','p','d']
    ProIndices                     [(range(0,1,1)),(0,),(1,2,3,),(4,5,6,7,8,)]

You can edit any key, and get plot using the cmdlet

.. code:: powershell

    PS> Get-InteractivePlot -PlotlyHashTable $x

--------------

    If you have disconnected K-path, you can join it in figure
    automatically be using
    ``$x.JoinPathAt="[break points indices array]"`` in plot arguments
    ``$x=Get-Args -switches``. Say we have ``'L'`` and ``'M'`` points at
    index ``19,20`` and do not have kpoints between them, we can just
    set ``$x.JoinPathAt="[20]"`` and plotting function will do the job
    automatically.

--------------

-  You can plot DOS with three differnt switches ``-LinePlot``,
   ``-AreaPlot`` and ``StackPlot``. In addition you can use
   ``-HalfColumnWide`` switch to make less wide plot. Usage:

   .. code:: powershell

       PS> $x=Get-Args -DOS; $x

   ::

       Name                           Value                                           
       ----                           -----                                           
       textLocation                   [0.05,0.9]                                      
       DOS_Limit                      [0.0,0.6]                                       
       FigureHeight                   2.5                                             
       E_Limit                        [5,-5]                                          
       ProLabels                      ['Ga','s','p','d']                              
       ProIndices                     [(range(0,1,1)),(0,),(1,2,3,),(4,5,6,7,8,)] 

--

You can edit any key using ``$x.key="value"`` and get DOS plot using the
cmdlet

.. code:: powershell

    PS> Get-DensityPlot -LinePlot $x -HalfColumnWide

::

    Required files not found. Generating using 'Export-VaspRun' ...
    Files now exist. Plotting ...

-  Script for converting LOCPOT into plane and plottable data formats is
   here now! Use ``Export-LOCPOT`` function.

--

-  Make Slab in z-direction (make sure none of ``POSCAR`` have
   zx,zy,xz,yz non-zero i.e angle c should be 90, otherwise result will
   be wrong. Rotate POSCAR in pure z-direction using Vesta before
   inputting here and after making slab, rotate it back. Also planes
   should have complete site, e.g. out of 8 sites in plane, if 4 are at
   z=0 and 4 at z=0.97, this will results in wrong merge.

--

.. code:: powershell

-  This cmdlet gets sites number for a layer with given z coordinate
   value upto 2 decimal place. These sites could be input to
   ``Enable-SelectiveDynamics``.

   .. code:: powershell

       PS> Select-SitesInLayers -InputPOSCAR .\POSCAR.vasp -Array_2Decimal 0.00,0.25

-  This is good only for slabs with number of layers less than 100 as
   two decimal places are slected. For more than 100 layers in
   z-direction, either use ``Enable-SelectiveDynamics`` with explicit
   sites number provided or contact me to make the script flexible. The
   number of layers less than 100 is kept on purpose, when we dope a
   single element in a slab, coordinates are displaced a little and it
   seems like a new layer. But no issue here, because you will not miss
   your selected layer as long as you use first two decimals (without
   rounding).

--

-  You can get X,Y,Z coordinates of layers in a POSCAR for input
   argument in ``Select-SitesInLayers`` cmdlet by using the command.

-  Automation functions are here to boost the productivity. For example,
   to know band gap, spin-orbit split-off, use the following functions.

   .. code:: powershell

       PS> Show-BandInfo 9 #returns information about band as output below.

Above command Can return bandwidth if smaller index is first say 9 10,
or of same band 9 9. This is extemely useful to find the Bandwith
between VBM and Minimim value of energy on lowest band. try:

Present-It
----------

The `Beamer-Timer <https://github.com/massgh/Beamer-Timer>`__ is
available as standslone repository but it is included in this package as
well. You can get a beamer presenatation file immediately in your
working folder by running

.. code:: powershell

    PS> New-Presentation -Blank #or use -Template switch

This will generate a ``main.tex`` file. You can create a loop in
powershell to make slides automatically for your all pictures in
subdirectories.

--

    You will get a bonus Reveal-Markdown directory containing a
    ``reveal.md`` file and a theme ``myserif.css``. If you have
    `vscode-reveal <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=evilz.vscode-reveal>`__
    extension installed on `VSCode <https://code.visualstudio.com/>`__,
    you can create interactive HTML presentation just using markdown and
    can also convert it to PDF and static HTML website like
    `revealjs <https://revealjs.com/>`__.
